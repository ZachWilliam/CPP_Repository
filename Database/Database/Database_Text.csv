101;Heading for distant shores, our heros find themselves locked in a battle with the elements. Upon the  Artemis our heros are battered by storms for days, with no end in sight. A resounding  crash comes from the dark waters, the ship shaking beneath their feet. With a mighty heave the waves push against the wounded ship, throwing our heros overboard and into the thrashing brine.;Narrator
102;Coarse sand is the first thing you feel as you come to. Laying face down in the hot sun, you rise and take stock of your surroundings. It appears you've landed on an island with no inhabitants nearby. To your left the open  ocean, the fury you have endured having left no evidence of it's passing on the rolling blue surface. A rock wall on your right, encircling a small hill with a cave entrance near the summit. ;Narrator
;;
201;The cave is dark as you enter, your eyes adjusting enough that you spot a torch and flint. With a quick strike your light source is lit and the encroaching shadow retreats. You're free to proceed into the unknown depths. ;Narrator
202;The sound of water dripping keeps a steady time in the echos around you. Bats are retreating from your light, some flying deeper into the cave or back the way you came. Monsters can be heard moving farther in. Ready yourself.;Narrator
203;Pressing deeper into the cave, you hear shufflings in the darkened area just beyond your torch's reach. The eyes of your potential foes catch the light occasionally, showing  interest in your progress.  You grip your weapon tighter, the exit can't be too far. ;Narrator
