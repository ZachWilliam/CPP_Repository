101;Heading for distant shores, our heros find themselves locked in a battle with the elements. Upon the  Artemis our heros are battered by storms for days, with no end in sight. A resounding  crash comes from the dark waters, the ship shaking beneath their feet. With a mighty heave the waves push against the wounded ship, throwing our heros overboard and into the thrashing brine.;Narrator
102;Coarse sand is the first thing you feel as you come to. Laying face down in the hot sun, you rise and take stock of your surroundings. It appears you've landed on an island with no inhabitants nearby. To your left the open  ocean, the fury you have endured having left no evidence of it's passing on the rolling blue surface. A rock wall on your right, encircling a small hill with a cave entrance near the summit. ;Narrator
201;The cave is dark as you enter, your eyes adjusting enough that you spot a torch and flint. With a quick strike your light source is lit and the encroaching shadow retreats. You're free to proceed into the unknown depths. ;Narrator
202;The sound of water dripping keeps a steady time in the echos around you. Bats are retreating from your light, some flying deeper into the cave or back the way you came. Monsters can be heard moving farther in. Ready yourself.;Narrator
203;Pressing deeper into the cave, you hear shufflings in the darkened area just beyond your torch's reach. The eyes of your potential foes catch the light occasionally, showing  interest in your progress.  You grip your weapon tighter, the exit can't be too far. ;Narrator
301;You step into from the cave into the sunlight. /*determine vantage point*/ ;Narrator
302;"The streets around you are empty as you traverse the town. Signs hanging from shop doors say ""out to lunch"" or ""under renovation"". As you enter the town square you see a magestic fountain depicting an odd scene of cherub angels tossing bread crumbs to ducks with human legs. A man stands alone admiring the statue, his suit and top hat a confusing bright orange colour. ";Narrator
303;You approach the mechanism holding the drawbrdge upright, setting the crank. With a swift kick, you send the crank spinning as the draw bridge drops. With a mighty slam and a rush of wind the drawbridge is opened and you know you're ready to face destiny.;Narrator
311;"""Hello friend! However did you get here?""The odd man cries out in delight, cutting you off before you can answer."" Our island has been cut off from the mainland by a kraken and we haven't had new visitors in  a while."" He grabs the lapel of his jacket and puffs out his chest.""Mayor Exposition, at your service."" ";Mayor Exposition
312;"I would love to stay and chat but as you can see, he says with a sweeping gesture around himself,""I am a very busy man, and you need a quest. I've chosen to hire you to fight that kraken but first you need to get the crank to lower the draw bridge."" He looks at the shadow of the statue. ""Oh my! Look at the time. Yes you best be off. Use the /*direction*/ gate. You'll find a /*quest item area*/ where the crank was taken.""";Mayor Exposition
