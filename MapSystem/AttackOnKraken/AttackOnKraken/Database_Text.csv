1;0;1;Heading for distant shores, our heroes find themselves locked in a battle with the elements. Upon the Artemis our heroes are battered by storms for days, with no end in sight. A resounding crash comes from the dark waters, the ship shaking beneath their feet. With a mighty heave the waves push against the wounded ship, throwing our heroes overboard and into the thrashing brine.;Narrator 
2;0;2;Coarse sand is the first thing you feel as you come to. Laying face down in the hot sun, you rise and take stock of your surroundings. It appears you've landed on an island with no inhabitants nearby. To your left the open ocean, the fury you have endured having left no evidence of it's passing on the rolling blue surface. A rock wall on your right, encircling a small hill with a cave entrance near the summit. ;Narrator 
3;0;1;The cave is dark as you enter, your eyes adjusting enough that you spot a torch and flint. With a quick strike your light source is lit and the encroaching shadow retreats. You're free to proceed into the unknown depths. ;Narrator 
4;0;1;Pressing deeper into the cave, you hear shuffling in the darkened area just beyond your torch's reach. The eyes of potential foes catch the light occasionally, showing interest in your progress.  You grip your weapon tighter, the exit can't be too far. ;Narrator 
5;0;1;The sound of water dripping keeps a steady time in the echoes around you. Bats are retreating from your light, flying back the way you came. A bright light can be seen ahead, silhouetting a lone figure. Prepare for battle!;Narrator 
6;0;1;You step from the cave into the sunlight. You can see the ocean south of you, with a small town to your West.;Narrator 
6;0;2;"The streets around you are empty as you traverse the town. Signs hanging from shop doors say ""out to lunch"" or ""under renovation"". As you enter the town square you see a majestic fountain depicting an odd scene of cherub angels tossing bread crumbs to ducks with human legs. A man stands alone admiring the statue, his suit and top hat a confusing bright orange colour. """;Narrator 
6;0;3;You approach a mechanism standing alone across the river from a drawbridge which is risen and inaccessible. Seems you need to find something that fits here.;Narrator 
6;0;4;You approach the mechanism holding the drawbridge upright, setting the crank. With a swift kick, you send the crank spinning as the draw bridge drops. With a mighty slam and a rush of wind the drawbridge is opened and you know you're ready to face destiny.;Narrator 
6;1;1;"""Hello friend! However did you get here?"" The odd man cries out in delight, cutting you off before you can answer. ""Our island has been cut off from the mainland by a monster and we haven't had new visitors in a while."" He grabs the lapel of his jacket and puffs out his chest.""Mayor Exposition, at your service.""";Mayor Exposition 
6;1;2;"""I would love to stay and chat but as you can see,"" he says with a sweeping gesture around himself,"" I am a very busy man, and you need a quest. I've chosen to hire you to fight that monster but first you need to get the crank to lower the draw bridge."" He looks at the shadow of the statue. ""Oh my! Look at the time. Yes you best be off. Use the East gate. You'll find an old ruin where the crank was taken.""";Mayor Exposition 
6;1;3;""".. Well.. Off you go."" He gives you a look like he cannot fathom why you are still standing there. As you turn to go you hear him mutter, ""what an odd fellow.""";Mayor Exposition 
6;1;4;"""My friends! You've returned!"" He calls at your approach. ""Were you able to find the crank? Yes? Wonderful! Quickly to the harbour! The drawbridge to the South can now be dropped!""";Mayor Exposition 
6;2;1;"""They come from the cave, from the beach beyond. Opening the way for us to survive. To the old city. Find the handle spin it round. Drop the bridge and save the town. It's over Anakin, I have the high ground.""";Crazed Local 
6;3;1;You see a dwarf, sitting before a cold forge, staring into it's dark depths. You clear your throat and he turns. ""Hello travelers. You've come a long way to an empty shop. I don't have any stock as you can see.""" The racks around you are devoid of anything of value. """With the monster blocking the harbour we can't get new materials in. If you haven't already, speak to the Mayor in the middle of town. He might have something for adventurers like yourselves."""";Weapons Smith
6;4;1;You approach a workbench, the chest piece of iron armour resting upon it, muttering heard from within. The armour tilts suddenly and falls over, spilling out a gnome with a great puffball of pink hair. When he spots you he pops to his feet. """Oh! Hello! I haven't had visitors in so long! Sadly I have no wares with that abomination guarding the harbour. Should that clear up feel free to return to Barnaby's Battlements!""" He turns and dives back into the piece of armour, righting it from inside, the muttering resuming.;Armour Smith
6;5;1;A human woman stands behind the counter of the Inn. ""Welcome. I am sorry to say we have no available beds for travellers. We haven't been able to clean our beds for a couple months now because the maid wandered into the harbour and was snatched up by that monster. You can however record your adventure over there.""" She points to a small guest book by the door. """Now if you don't mind, I must return to work."" She looks back down behind the desk. A quick glance shows her reading a novel that was likely best left at home.;Inn Keeper
7;0;1;Entering the ruins of Old Grove you see buildings worn by time, overrun by Nature's slow inevitable grasp. Tall thick grass knots the interior of buildings with collapsed rooves and walls, giving ample place for a monstrous ambush. Be on your guard.; Narrator 
7;0;2;You open the chest. A mysterious golden glow spills forth as you lift the lid, an odd tune playing in your head, like a distant memory of the User. Inside you find the crank! Success! Now the monster awaits! Make haste!;Narrator 
8;0;1;You enter the harbour, the sea before you placid and calm, a couple abandoned and unused ships are docked, gently riding the waves in their mooring. As you take in the scene the waters are disturbed. You spot a shadow moving beneath the waves. The shadow is still for a minute, yellow eyes piercing the increasingly chaotic waters, watching you. With a blast of water the Kraken lunges but takes to the sky on large leathery wings. It's an Air Kraken, make peace with your Creator. Suddenly with the fury of the ocean itself the creature surges forth. Ready yourself!; Narrator 
8;0;2;The Kraken recoils from your assault, slipping back under the waves. The shadow is still for a minute, yellow eyes piercing the disturbed waters, watching you. With a blast of water the Kraken lunges again, but takes to the sky on large leathery wings. It's an Air Kraken, make peace with your Creator.;Narrator 
9;0;1;The Air Kraken crashes into the waves, sending spray around our heros. Mayor Exposition comes into the harbour screaming in horror! ""Marvin!"" The Mayor runs up to you. ""Scoundrels! Criminals! Animals! You killed Marvin not the Monster!""" He points to a nearby dingy, barely big enough to hold the party. ""Get out of our city! Take that and leave before you cause more harm!""" As you sail away in your tiny boat, the mainland coming into view, you look behind and see a monstrosity made of living ocean claw its way into the island, engulfing it. You're journey continues forward! To lands unknown!"";Narrator
